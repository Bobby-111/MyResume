    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <pre>    I am a passionate and innovative student with a keen interest in technology, creative projects, and cultural exploration. 
    My journey includes learning Java programming, designing real-world applications, and participating in national and state-level events.

    I recently appeared as a runner-up in a national-level youth festival organized by Colors, held at Aditya University, Surampalem.
    And stood as the Winners of district-level YouthFestival.

    I am also working on projects like a 'Health Care Kit' app to improve medicine management and reminders, showcasing my ability to blend technology with practical solutions.
    With a strong inclination towards creativity, Iâ€™ve explored designing posters and participated in youth festivals, focusing on themes that celebrate tradition and innovation.

    I am deeply fascinated by the future of AI, machine learning, and their applications across various fields, including farming and healthcare. 
    As I grow, I aim to leverage technology to solve real-world problems and inspire positive change.</pre>
